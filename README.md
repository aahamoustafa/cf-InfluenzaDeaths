# Influenza Impact Analysis Case Study

## Project Overview

This project analyzes the seasonal impact of influenza in the United States, focusing on vulnerable populations (those younger than 5 and older than 65). The goal is to guide a medical staffing agency in proactively planning for the influenza season by identifying staffing needs across states and prioritizing areas based on the vulnerability of their populations.

### Key Questions Answered:
1. **Who is most vulnerable during flu season?**
2. **Where should we focus our resources?**
3. **How can we effectively protect our most vulnerable populations?**



## Motivation

Influenza disproportionately affects vulnerable populations, often requiring additional hospital staff during peak flu seasons. This analysis supports a medical staffing agency in optimizing resource allocation to minimize understaffing and overstaffing across U.S. states.


## Business Objective

- **Goal**: Create a staffing plan for the medical agency to allocate temporary nurses, physician assistants, and doctors based on influenza trends and vulnerable population data.
- **Stakeholders**: Medical agency administrators, hospitals, vulnerable patients, and frontline healthcare staff.



## Data Sources

This project integrates and analyzes data from multiple credible sources:
1. **CDC Influenza Deaths by State**
2. **U.S. Census Bureau Population Data**



## Methodology

The project followed a structured analysis approach:
1. **Data Cleaning and Preparation**: Ensured data consistency and integrity across multiple datasets.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Examined trends in influenza deaths, vulnerable population sizes, and seasonal impacts across states.
3. **Spatial and Temporal Analysis**: Created maps and time-series visualizations to identify high-risk states and flu seasonality patterns.
4. **Hypothesis Testing**: Analyzed correlations between vulnerable population sizes and influenza death rates.
5. **Visualization and Storytelling**: Used Tableau to craft an engaging and informative story for stakeholders.



## Key Findings

1. **Vulnerable Populations Are at Higher Risk**: States like New York, California, and Pennsylvania showed the highest percentage of deaths in vulnerable populations.
2. **Regional Disparities**: States such as Virginia, Tennessee, and Alaska face disproportionately high mortality rates, indicating an urgent need for resource prioritization.
3. **Flu Seasonality**: Influenza trends vary across states, but the peak typically occurs between December and February, necessitating targeted staffing during these months.




## Visualizations

Interactive visualizations were created using Tableau to provide actionable insights: [Influenza Story on Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/abdelrahman.moustafa7565/viz/InfluenzaDeathsProject/InfluenzaStory)




## Next Steps

Based on the findings, the following recommendations were proposed:
1. **Resource Prioritization**: Focus on high-risk states like Virginia and Tennessee for immediate staffing intervention.
2. **Vaccination Campaigns**: Increase efforts to vaccinate vulnerable populations in high-need areas.
3. **Proactive Staffing**: Adjust staffing plans based on seasonal influenza peaks in each state.



## Tools Used

- **Microsoft Excel**: Preliminary data analysis and profiling, Data cleaning, transformation, and hypothesis testing.
- **Tableau**: Data visualization and storytelling.
