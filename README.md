# Influenza Impact Analysis Case Study

## Introduction

Influenza, commonly known as the flu, has a significant seasonal impact in the United States. Vulnerable populations, such as children under 5 and adults over 65, face severe health risks, often requiring hospitalization. Hospitals and clinics experience increased demand during flu season, which creates staffing challenges. This case study explores how data-driven insights can guide a medical staffing agency in allocating resources effectively to address these challenges.

### Problem Statement

During peak flu seasons, hospitals struggle to meet the increased demand for care, especially in states with larger vulnerable populations. The medical staffing agency needs a proactive plan to allocate temporary healthcare workers efficiently, ensuring adequate coverage without overstaffing.



## Methodology

This analysis was conducted using a structured approach:

### Data Collection
1. **Data Sources**:
   - CDC Influenza Deaths by State
   - U.S. Census Bureau Population Data
 

### Data Cleaning and Preparation
- Ensured consistency and accuracy across datasets.
- Addressed missing values and standardized formats.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Examined trends in influenza deaths and vulnerable populations.
- Identified seasonal patterns in flu prevalence.

### Hypothesis Testing
- Analyzed correlations between vulnerable population sizes and influenza death rates.
- Tested seasonal peaks to determine staffing needs.

### Visualization
- Created spatial and temporal visualizations using Tableau to identify high-risk areas and seasonal trends.



## Findings

### Key Insights
1. **High Vulnerability States**:
   - States like New York, California, and Pennsylvania have the highest percentage of deaths in vulnerable populations.
2. **Regional Disparities**:
   - States such as Virginia, Tennessee, and Alaska face high mortality rates, requiring urgent resource allocation.
3. **Seasonal Trends**:
   - Influenza peaks between December and February in most states, highlighting the need for targeted staffing during these months.


### Recommendations

Based on the analysis, the following steps are proposed:

1. **Targeted Resource Allocation**:
   - Prioritize staffing in high-risk states like Virginia and Tennessee.
2. **Vaccination Campaigns**:
   - Focus on increasing vaccination rates among vulnerable populations in high-need areas.
3. **Proactive Staffing**:
   - Develop staffing plans aligned with seasonal influenza peaks.

- **Tableau**: Data visualization and storytelling.


## Conclusion

This case study demonstrates the power of data-driven decision-making in addressing critical healthcare challenges. By identifying high-risk states and seasonal trends, the medical staffing agency can allocate resources more effectively, ensuring better care for vulnerable populations. Proactive planning based on this analysis can reduce understaffing and overstaffing, improving healthcare outcomes during flu season.
